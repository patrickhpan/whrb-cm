Yet another boilerplate. It uses `react` and `react-router` integrated with `redux` in [reducks](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be) style. Styling is handled by `SCSS`. The `node` backend is structured around `express`. The development server hot reloads both for frontend and backend changes.

This sample currently contains a simple counter to demonstrate `reducks` and a mock authentication backend.

Requires `.env` to be present in the root to run.

To develop, `npm install` and `npm run dev`. 

To deploy, `npm run deploy`.
